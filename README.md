## Overview

This project was to complete a response page which shows some static results relating to some skills. I didn't complete this to be responsive, this is a static page

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
